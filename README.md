# Bikesharing NYC Story Challenge

## Overview:

During this module we developed visualizations using Tableau to chart an understanding of the Bikesharing service called CitiBike. The [NYC Story](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/forrest.casey/viz/bikesharing_16401310114170/Story1) outlines the basics of the findings during the module.
The following analysis is being used to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. To solidify the proposal, one of the key stakeholders would like to see a bike trip analysis with further investigative visualizations. 

## Results:

### Over 2.3 million rides occurred in August of 2019, most of whom were subscribers & males:

### Male riders make up the majority of the bike sharing service:

### This highlights peak hours for the most frequent riding times, of which seem to be before and after work hours, suggesting more adults who are working full time jobs, or travelign to and from work.
