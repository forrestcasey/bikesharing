# Bikesharing NYC Story Challenge

## Overview:

During this module we developed visualizations using Tableau to chart an understanding of the Bikesharing service called CitiBike. The [NYC Story](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/forrest.casey/viz/bikesharing_16401310114170/Story1) outlines the basics of the findings during the module.
The following analysis is being used to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. To solidify the proposal, one of the key stakeholders would like to see a bike trip analysis with further investigative visualizations. 

## Results:

### Over 2.3 million rides occurred in August of 2019, most of whom were subscribers & males:

### Most of the rides were less than an hour:

### Male riders make up the majority of the bike sharing service:

### This highlights peak hours for male riders contrasted with female riding times during the day. They have the same mapping of times, with the only real difference being that males make up most of riders during these times:

### This highlights peak hours for the most frequent riding times, of which seem to be before and after work hours, suggesting more adults who are working full time jobs/ traveling to and from work possibly:

This shows ridership by Customer vs Subscriber, where male subscribers make up the majority, and seem to have peak riding times over 200k reported on Tuesday, Thursday, and Fridays.

## Summary:
Given this report, these bikes seem to be used more so for commuting for work, and used most male subscribers. This info will help the investment team in potentially advertising  geared toward the male population for increased profits, and additionally predict suitable repair times for the bikes given the most active times of ridership use are clearly represented statistically through these visulizations.
